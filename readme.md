Exploring Agentic AI with LangChain & OllamaThis project provides a set of starting scripts to explore agentic AI patterns using Python, LangChain, and a local Ollama instance.1. SetupInstall OllamaFirst, ensure you have Ollama installed and running.Pull a ModelYou need a model for LangChain to connect to. We recommend starting with Llama 3.ollama pull llama3
Create a Python EnvironmentIt's highly recommended to use a virtual environment.python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install DependenciesInstall the required Python packages.pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Running the ScriptsMake sure your Ollama application is running before executing any script.01_simple_chain.pyWhat it does: This is the "Hello, World!" of LangChain and Ollama. It shows how to:Connect to your local Ollama model.Create a simple prompt template.Create a basic chain (LLMChain) to pass a variable to the prompt and get a response.How to run:python 01_simple_chain.py
02_agent_with_tools.pyWhat it does: This script demonstrates a fundamental agentic pattern: an agent that can reason and use tools.It defines a custom tool (e.g., get_word_length).It uses a "ReAct" (Reasoning and Acting) prompt, which trains the model to "think" about what tool to use, use it, observe the result, and then formulate a final answer.It creates an AgentExecutor to manage the agent's reasoning loop.How to run:python 02_agent_with_tools.py
Try asking it questions like: "How many letters are in the word 'serendipity'?"Then try: "What is the capital of France?" (It won't have a tool for this and will say so).03_agent_debate.pyWhat it does: This script showcases a more complex, multi-agent pattern. It sets up a "debate" between two AI agents with different personalities or goals.It defines two separate agents, each with its own prompt and "persona."It programmatically runs a conversation loop, where the output of Agent 1 becomes the input for Agent 2, and vice-versa, for a set number of turns.This pattern is a foundation for more complex multi-agent systems like simulations, hierarchical teams, or critiques.How to run:python 03_agent_debate.py
